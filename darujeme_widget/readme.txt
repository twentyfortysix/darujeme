Simple widget for <a href="https://www.darujme.cz">Darujeme</a> a crowd donation, mainly for non-profits in Czech republic.

== Description ==

The "Darujeme" widget gives you easy way how to point your donators to your project on the Darujeme.cz donation portal.
You can setup values such as client ID, project ID, amount, frequency,... and lets you style it all up to you wish, no clumsy iframe embed.


== Installation ==

As usual. If you don't know how, check out the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins">official how-to</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
Why did you make it?

Coz I have been tired of their (darujeme.cz) native ugly embed. After many integration to many websites I said, "No, enough is enough" and I coded this down.
